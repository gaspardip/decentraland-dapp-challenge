## Setup

First you will need need to setup a local ethereum development environment and deploy the Dummy Token contract there, to do that [follow these instructions](https://github.com/decentraland/dummy-token#setup).

Then follow the instructions below:

1. Run `cp .env.example .env` and fill the environment variables
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Change your MetaMask network to "localhost"
5. Connect to the dApp

I recommend you add Hardhat's prefunded accounts to MetaMask to make the process easier.
